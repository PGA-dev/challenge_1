# Challenge 1 Preview Card

### Approach

#### CSS
- simple css approach
- root colors
- imports used for fonts
- used @media for the mobile and desktop distinction
- layout was pretty close, still would like to tweak a more elegant solution
- picture is a mixer, not an HTML import


#### HTML
- used divs for wrapper, flexbox container for 2 flex items (picture and text), and a flexbox container for the text section as well

### Overall

#### Time
- approx 3-4 hours

#### Accuracy
- I would rate it about 90-95%, maybe a little closer

#### Pedagogical 

### Future
- realized that it might have been easier, and far cooler to use a simple React app and import a separate card; then for actual data, you could update the DB or JSON
- Kind of hacked the Viewport, really could use some simple JS to hit the DOM and resize
